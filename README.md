# Portfolio Home Page (DEPI Task)

## Description

A simple static portfolio home page. The project contains `index.html`, `style.css`, and an `images/` folder with assets used by the page.

## How to view

- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view locally.
- Tip: Use the Live Server extension in VS Code for automatic reload while developing.
- You can also publish the project using **GitHub Pages**.

## Project structure

```
index.html
style.css
images/
  ├─ 1/
  ├─ 2/
  └─ 3/
```

## Features

- Simple static HTML/CSS page, easy to modify.
- Layouts built using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for flexible and modular sections.
- Smooth hover effects and subtle animations using CSS **transitions** and **transforms**.
- Responsive image handling with `object-fit` and a horizontally scrollable image gallery.
- Visual styling using CSS **linear-gradient**, fixed header, and rounded elements.

## Techniques & Technologies

- **HTML** (semantic structure)
- **CSS** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Transforms, Transitions, Object-fit, Gradients)
- Google Fonts (`Jost`)
- No JavaScript — purely a static HTML/CSS project (can be extended with JS for interactivity)

## Notes on responsiveness

- The layout uses flexible CSS primitives (Flexbox & Grid) but there are no media queries yet. Add responsive breakpoints to improve the mobile experience.
